#1 What is the difference between a tuple and a list?
# A List is a collection of variables that can be modified, tuple is like a list but cannot be modified. While lists seem more enticing due to this fact, arguments can be made for
#tuples as they can be iterated through quicker and takes up less space in memory compared to lists.

#2 How is a list different than a dictionary?
# Dictionaries hold a key-value pair of variables, whereas a list only holds single value variables. This lets the user designate the key to access the variable/value, in a list
#the user must use index of the list starting at the integer 0. A dictionary is once again faster and takes up less space in memory.

#3 Create a program that prints a list of words in random order. The program should print all the words and not repeat any.
import random

tupleWords = ("apples", "zebra", "mountain", "chip", "monty", "beanstalk", "moon")
listWords = []

while len(listWords) is not len(tupleWords):
    word = random.choice(tupleWords)
    if word in listWords:
        continue
    else :
        print(word)
        listWords.append(word)
